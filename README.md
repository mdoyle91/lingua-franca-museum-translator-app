# LinguaFranca-Museum Text Translator App

![logo](.static/image/LinguaFranca_Logo.png)

LinguaFranca allows you to access text descriptions in your native language without having to use a translator app in the moment. While translators apps may come in handy when trying to order food or communicate with people in conversational manner, they often fail to provide an accurate translation. When in a museum or other cultural institution, you're trying to grasp a concept or a term that may be foreign to you as well, so an accurate translation is a must! All of our translations have been vetted by real people in order to ensure that nothing gets lost in translation and to ensure that your museum-going experience is seamless.
